## How to work with extension
To block a website or resource, enter part of its name into the input field with the placeholder "Type Block URL" — for example, "facebook" will block all related subdomains. In the field with the placeholder "Type Redirect URL", enter the full redirect address including the protocol, such as "https://google.com". If the redirect field is left empty, the site will be blocked without redirection. Click the Save button to apply the rule. To update a rule, delete the old one and create a new entry.

### Project Description

This Chrome extension was developed as the final project for the CS50x course from Harvard, implemented using JavaScript. The primary function of the extension is to help users manage their time online by limiting distractions from specific websites. It is publicly available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kfhgdgokgjmdboidlhphajinmgpcmmec) and has successfully passed all verification processes required by Google.

The extension allows users to set rules that control access to certain websites. Users can either block websites entirely or redirect them to another, more productive page. The heart of the extension is the **Manifest V3**, which provides metadata and defines the permissions required by the extension.

## Structure and Key Files

### 1. Manifest (`manifest.json`)
The manifest is the cornerstone of the extension. It contains all the necessary metadata and configuration for the Chrome extension. Manifest V3 is a major update by Chrome, providing enhanced security and performance for extensions. This file defines the extension's permissions, such as what kind of data it can access, which scripts can run, and what UI components are used (like popups or background workers). The manifest specifies the following:

- **Name and Description**: Describes the extension's purpose for users.
- **Version**: Tracks the version of the extension for updates.
- **Permissions**: Declares which permissions are needed (more details below).
- **Background Service Worker**: Runs in the background to handle tasks like rule creation or monitoring.
- **Action**: Defines the popup interface (described below) triggered when users click the extension's icon.
- **Icons**: Declares different icon sizes, which are automatically selected by the browser depending on where the icon is displayed (extension bar, context menu, etc.).
- **Default Locale**: Sets the primary language for the extension, enabling internationalization.

### 2. `index.html`
This is the entry point to the extension's user interface. It defines the popup that users interact with. The popup opens when users click the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar. In the HTML, you'll find the layout of the popup, which includes buttons for adding or removing rules, as well as a list of current access rules.

### 3. `popup.css`
Contains the styling rules for the popup interface. The design is minimalist, focusing on usability with a clean and functional layout. By avoiding excessive visual elements, the extension remains lightweight and easy to navigate. CSS styles define the appearance of buttons, text input fields, and the list of websites users are managing.

### 4. `popup.js`
This script is responsible for handling the popup's interactive elements. When the popup opens, it retrieves and displays the user's saved rules from Chrome's `storage.sync`. This allows users to manage rules across different devices. Users can add or remove rules through a simple interface. Whenever a new rule is created, it's stored using `chrome.storage.sync`, and the popup is updated dynamically to reflect the changes.

### 5. `background.js`
A crucial part of the extension, the background script runs continuously in the background and monitors the extension’s storage. It listens for changes and dynamically updates or removes access rules using the `declarativeNetRequest` API, which is part of Manifest V3. This API allows the extension to block or redirect network requests based on user-defined rules without needing full network access permissions. The `background.js` script also handles the creation of redirect rules when the user specifies an alternative URL for blocked sites.

## Features

### 1. Site Blocking and Redirection
Users can block any website by adding it to a list in the extension's popup. When a blocked site is visited, the extension prevents it from loading. Users also have the option to set up a redirection to another URL. For instance, if they frequently get distracted by social media, they can redirect themselves to a more productive website whenever they attempt to visit a blocked site.

### 2. Cross-device Synchronization
The extension uses Chrome's `storage.sync` to store rules, ensuring that changes made on one device are automatically synchronized across all other devices using the same Google account. This is particularly useful for users who frequently switch between multiple devices.

### 3. Minimalist User Interface
The extension's interface is designed for simplicity. The popup window provides an intuitive experience where users can quickly view, add, or delete rules for specific websites. There's no clutter—just straightforward functionality.

### 4. Internationalization (i18n)
The extension supports multiple languages through the `chrome.i18n` API. Currently, six languages are available: English, German, French, Hindi, Italian, and Ukrainian. The `_locales` folder contains subfolders for each supported language, with `messages.json` files that provide translations for the extension's text elements. The browser automatically detects the user’s language settings and displays the appropriate translation. The `i18n.js` file simplifies the process of populating the popup with the correct text in each language.

### 5. Dynamic Rule Management
The background script, in combination with the `declarativeNetRequest` API, ensures that rules are enforced dynamically. When a user adds a site to be blocked, the extension immediately registers the rule without needing to restart the browser or reload the page.

## Icons

The extension includes several icons in different sizes, located in the `images` directory. These icons are defined in the manifest and are used in different contexts:

- **16x16**: Displayed in the browser’s tab bar.
- **48x48**: Used in extension management pages.
- **128x128**: Shown in the Chrome Web Store listing.

Chrome automatically selects the appropriate icon size based on where the icon is being used, ensuring a consistent and sharp appearance across all contexts.

---

## Permissions

To function effectively, the extension requires a few specific permissions, which are explicitly declared in the manifest:

### 1. DeclarativeNetRequest
This permission allows the extension to block or redirect network requests without needing access to all of the user's browsing activity. The `declarativeNetRequest` API enhances security by enabling the extension to manage web requests in a more controlled way, reducing privacy risks for users.

### 2. Storage
The `storage` permission is required for storing user-defined rules and syncing them across devices via `chrome.storage.sync`. This ensures that users' preferences are persistent and available on any device where they are logged in with the same Google account.

### 3. ActiveTab
The `activeTab` permission allows the extension to interact with the currently open tab in the browser when the user clicks on the extension’s icon. This is essential for applying rules on-demand and making immediate changes based on user input.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the extension is fully functional, several ideas for enhancements are under consideration:

- **Custom Time Limits**:  
   Implementing time-based blocking, where users can set specific time windows during which access to certain websites is restricted.

- **Category-based Blocking**:  
   Grouping websites into categories (e.g., social media, news) to allow bulk blocking or redirection by category.

- **Detailed Statistics**:  
   Providing insights into users’ browsing habits by tracking time spent on blocked sites and offering reports that help users understand and improve their time management.

- **User Accounts and Profiles**:  
   Allowing users to create profiles with different sets of rules, enabling flexibility based on different contexts (e.g., work mode vs. personal mode).
